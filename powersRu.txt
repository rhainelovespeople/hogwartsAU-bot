going to levels of irony the world hasn't seen before
mansplaining people's own personalities
falling in love with 3 people at once
developing a crush on a professor
whining
starting 10 books and not finishing one
not returning books to the library
going into a depressive episode
getting out of a depressive episode
writing an extensive diary entry
overthinking every social interaction
