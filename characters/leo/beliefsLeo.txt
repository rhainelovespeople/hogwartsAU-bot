therapy ain't shit, meds are where it's at
people should keep their kinks to themselves
fucking Larries
fight me
Polina Gagarina is seriously underrated
I'm a writer who can't write
I wish I was digging up some ancient corpses rn
Potions are the worst
the only class worse than Potions is Divination
Slytherins aren't that bad, you bitches
I miss my PC
let's replace quidditch with CS tournaments
tickling the pear tickles my fancy
it wasn't my fault my potion ate your shoes
I'm sorry you feel that way about the eternal stickiness potion incident
no Great Hall feast can fill the void in me
I would look so attractive with a beard
Hogwarts should build some elevators
