starting to solve a math problem and not stopping
explaining math to his friends, and everyone nearby
not talking to people
reading 3 sci-fi novels
referencing applicable xkcds
making a sad cat noise
drinking too much tea
over-analysis paralysis
cutting off all clothes tags
overthinking every social interaction
